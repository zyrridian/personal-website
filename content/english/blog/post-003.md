After what feels like an eternity of anticipation, **Kessoku Band** has finally dropped their newest single, _Hikari no Naka e_ (_Into the Light_). This song isn't just melodies; it's experiences wrapped in poetic ambiguity. For someone who has been following this journey since the anime aired, this song feels deeply personal, as if it's a continuation of Bocchi's story.

I've always loved the music of the Kessoku Band, but this time, something about the lyrics - particularly the equations - stirred my curiosity. It's not every day that a song blends music and math in such a metaphorical way. I couldn't resist diving into it. So here I am, sharing my thoughts and interpretations of this brilliant song.

## Musical Equations

{{< image src="images/blog/blog-003/img2.webp" caption="" alt="alter-text" height="" width="" position="center" command="fill" option="q100" class="img-fluid" title="image title"  webp="true" >}}

Hikari no Naka e is written by _Fujimori Genki_, the lyrics reveal the side of Bocchi's and how she grew up from being a socially anxious introvert into a confident eccentric performer. What caught my attention were the mathematical equations in the song which, actually, sounded more like a metaphors of Bocchi's state of mind and connection with music. It was just like each of equations reflected her internal struggle and growth.

Take, for instance, the first equation:

### (Me + Expectations - Anxiety) × Guitar = Rock

It seems pretty simple at first glance. Bocchi's expectations of herself, minus her ever-present anxiety, multiplied by her guitar, result in the raw energy of rock. The equation feels like a perfect encapsulation of her performances: chaotic, intense, and undeniably authentic. Her music becomes an outlet where the tension between her self-doubt and her aspirations transforms into something beautiful.

<!-- {{< image src="images/blog/blog-003/img3.gif" caption="" alt="alter-text" height="" width="" position="center" command="fill" option="q100" class="img-fluid" title="image title"  webp="true" >}} -->

As I explored further, I found myself trying to make sense of the other equations:

### (Me + You - Time) ÷ Guitar = A Concert

This one was more abstract until it clicked. It's not just about playing music - it's about the shared experience of a live performance. Bocchi and her bandmates come together, overcoming the constraints of time, to create something ephemeral and magical. The division by guitar suggests that their connection - their synergy - is mediated through their instruments.

### (Me + Society - Mutual Understanding) × Sympathy = A Strikeout

This was the most tricky to interpret. To me, it represents Bocchi's struggle to navigate a world that often feels alienating. When there's no mutual understanding, even sympathy can't bridge the gap, leaving her feeling like she's failed. But this equation isn't just about despair - it's a reminder of her resilience. Each "strikeout" pushes her to grow, to find new ways to connect.

### Me + You is bias, Sound ÷ Eternal Wheel = A Band

This final equation is poetic in its simplicity. The "Me + You" bias reflects the unique dynamics between Bocchi and her bandmates, shaped by their shared experiences and quirks. And "Sound ÷ Eternal Wheel"? To me, it's the essence of Kessoku Band - their music, looping endlessly in our hearts, becomes a symbol of their unity and purpose.

## Context and Connections

{{< image src="images/blog/blog-003/img4.webp" caption="" alt="alter-text" height="" width="" position="center" command="fill" option="q100" class="img-fluid" title="image title"  webp="true" >}}

These equations resonated with a story I read about someone reflecting on how they coped with the overwhelming pressures and expectations in their life. They shared how creative outlets became their lifeline, transforming those feelings into something meaningful. Bocchi's journey mirrors this experience, speaking to anyone who has ever felt out of place but found solace and strength in their passions.

What makes these equations even more fascinating is their possible link to other songs by Kessoku Band. _Ai Higuchi_, who wrote many of their lyrics, often weaves interconnected themes across tracks. For example, _Blue Spring and Western Sky_ is tied to _If I Could Be a Constellation_, creating a narrative thread. Could _Into the Light_ be part of this tapestry? It's a question that lingers, much like the song itself.

As I delved deeper into the lyrics, I recalled an insightful discussion I came across. Someone had shared their thoughts on the arithmetic operations in the song, attempting to decode the meanings behind addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It struck me how these equations, despite their abstractness, perfectly encapsulate Bocchi's journey. Addition symbolizes connection, subtraction reflects loss or struggle, multiplication amplifies emotions, and division seeks balance or perspective.

## Bocchi's Light: Stepping Into Her Own

{{< image src="images/blog/blog-003/img5.jpg" caption="" alt="alter-text" height="" width="" position="center" command="fill" option="q100" class="img-fluid" title="image title"  webp="true" >}}

One of the most poignant moments in the song is when Bocchi steps into the "light" with a newfound sense of confidence. This light isn't just a metaphor for success; it's the spotlight she's earned through her hard work and determination. It's a testament to her growth, both as a musician and as a person. The song's chorus captures this beautifully:

> The sound I truly love / Resonates in my heart / Even the light, once blinding / Now feels warm.

Here, the "light" becomes a symbol of acceptance. Bocchi is no longer paralyzed by fear - she's embraced her vulnerabilities and turned them into strengths. The warmth of the light reflects her joy in performing and connecting with others, something she once thought impossible.

## The Broader Journey: From Insecurity to Confidence

{{< image src="images/blog/blog-003/img6.jpg" caption="" alt="alter-text" height="" width="" position="center" command="fill" option="q100" class="img-fluid" title="image title"  webp="true" >}}

As I listened to Hikari no Naka e on repeat, I realized that this song isn't just about Bocchi - it's about all of us who have struggled with self-doubt, insecurity, and a sense of not fitting in. The song serves as a powerful reminder that even in our darkest times, there's a light waiting for us. It's a light that we can step into when we're ready, a light that symbolizes our journey toward confidence, connection, and self-acceptance.

In the end, Into the Light is more than just a song; it's an invitation to confront our fears and step into our own light, just like Bocchi. It's a message that no matter how complex or chaotic life may seem, there's always a way forward - a way that leads us toward the warmth and acceptance we all seek.

**[Verse 1]**
<br> (Me + Expectation - Anxiety) x Guitar = Rock
<br> (Me + You - Time) ÷ Guitar = Live Performance

**[Pre-Chorus]**
<br> Trembling with fear
<br> Eight bars before the showtime
<br> Breaking down the inferiority complex
<br> I leaped into the light

**[Chorus]**
<br> A new world was born
<br> This time, this place, like a pipe dream
<br> Every minute, every second is a miracle, a twinkling moment
<br> Let's drop meaning into the gaps of everyday life
<br> Even if things don't go well
<br> Evеn if I can't face forward
<br> This phrase, this song, the sound I rеally like
<br> Strumming hard, yet still just strumming
<br> Let's try to deliver, even if clumsy
<br> Let's tie it all together, no matter where it leads

**[Verse 2]**
<br> (Me + World - Communication) x Understanding = I'm Out
<br> Me + You are biased
<br> Sound ÷ Infinite Loop = Band, ah-ah
<br> (Ah, ah, ah)

**[Bridge]**
<br> Running around reality
<br> Idealism comes to a sudden stop
<br> Manipulating illusions
<br> Sitting in seiza on a remote island revealing my true self
<br> Throwing away preconceptions
<br> Feeling a premonition tonight
<br> A song that dives into the light ahead

**[Chorus]**
<br> A new world was born
<br> This time, this place, like a pipe dream
<br> Every minute, every second is a miracle, a twinkling moment
<br> Let's house our will in the gaps of everyday life
<br> Even if it's incomprehensible
<br> Even if it's nonsense
<br> This scale, this drive, the sound I really like
<br> No matter how I strum, it's still just strumming
<br> Let's try to deliver, even if clumsy
<br> Let's try to play, these days
<br> Let's tie it all together

**[Outro]**
<br> Now (Now), tomorrow too (Tomorrow too)
<br> More (More), surely
<br> No matter where it leads
